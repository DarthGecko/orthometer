# orthometer at korflab
**The project for getting orthologous introns and analyzing them for motifs**

So far we have:
* A way to download data from Phytozome's biomart with Python.
* Some data files to work with.
* Multiple format options

Working on:
* Giving FASTA headers JSON formats
* Organizing intron data into file structutes
* Motif finding algorithms
* Build up species list through queries
* make a separate yml file of filters and attributes for each biomart host or database.
