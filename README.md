**The project for getting orhologous introns and analyzing them for motifs**

So far we have:
* A way to download data from Phytozome's biomart with Pytho.
* Some data files to work with.


Working on:
* Making the biomart downloader more versatile for multiple filetypes
* Organizing intron data into file structutes
* Motif finding algorithms

Worth looking at again: https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi/blob/master/apps/biomart.py
